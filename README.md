## Todo App

After reading through the React docs and following along with their tutorial, I decided that I wanted
to make my first React application as I learn best by doing. This is a simple Todo application that I built, and it supports the standard CRUD operations that you would expect from a Todo app, along with the ability to search for todos, filter your list, and persist the data to local storage.

The application layout is based on a tutorial from Brad Traversy's Modern Javascript course. In that course, he uses Materialize to build the UI, but I decided to build the UI from scratch in order to learn more about CSS and building fully responsive UIs. Also, I decided that I wanted to learn more about React hooks, so I refactored the app to use only function components and hooks to provide the state. To run the application on your machine, simply follow the instructions below the screenshot. This was a really fun project to build, so I hope you enjoy it!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
